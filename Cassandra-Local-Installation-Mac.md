# STEPS TO INSTALL CASSANDRA LOCALLY IN MAC

This may not be a realistic example to install cassanda locally and run local cluster but sometime for demo purpose you may need this setup. This document will quickly help to achieve that.

### Create local directory where you need to keep your Cassandra Binaries

    mkdir -p ~/Documents/Cassandra/


### Download the Cassandra package whatever in the latest one. I have downloaded 3.11.3. There are various ways to download the package and curl is one of those

    curl -O http://www-us.apache.org/dist/cassandra/3.5/apache-cassandra-3.11.3-bin.tar.gz
    tar xzvf apache-cassandra-3.11.3-bin.tar.gz


### In case we need to upgrade Cassandra in the future, letâ€™s create a symbolic link to the Cassandra 3.5 directory. This will keep is from having to change environment variables later on.

    ln -s ~/opt/packages/cassandra/apache-cassandra-3.5 ~/opt/cassandra


### We want the ability to execute Cassandra commands from any directory so we will add Cassandra to our system PATH. Open your bash profile with your preferred text editor. I am using Sublime Text.

    vi ~/.bash_profile


### Now add the following to the bash profile file.

    if [ -d "$HOME/opt/cassandra" ]; then
        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/opt/cassandra/bin"
    fi


### Source your bash profile.

    source ~/.bash_profile


7. Verify Cassandra installation.

    cassandra -v
    expected output:
    3.5


## Note
If you have previous Cassandra installation which is not removed properly from .cassandra folder delete it accordingly before starting Cassandra

    rm -rf ./cassandra
